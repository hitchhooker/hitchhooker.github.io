career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    Being born in family of a C-programmer at Nokia, I learned to write with computer before handwriting and start programming at the age of 8.
    I have done web development ever since as well as learned programming languages and methods more near to the core. I am use to learning new
    technologies and languages, but to mention a few that gets me excited: Rust; memory safety with amazing compiler, 
    TailwindCSS; fully customizable CSS framework with inline classes, SvelteJs with TypeScript; no virtual DOM and compiled into vanilla JS,
    Laravel; PHP framework that provides easy to use and powerful full-stack tooling for PHP. 

    Right now I am based on small fishing village with word class waves at Portuguese coast, where I
    have set up myself office space optimal for remote work. I am happy here and mainly looking for a possibility to work remotely, but
    will also listen offers that could improve living standards elsewhere.
